# PhishTank API Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated PhishTank API support into the PhishNet phishing detection system. PhishTank provides a crowdsourced database of verified phishing URLs that complements the existing machine learning-based detection.

## What Was Added

### 1. Configuration Management (`backend/config.py`)
- Environment variable support using python-dotenv
- Settings class for centralized configuration
- PhishTank API key management
- Host and port configuration
- Helper methods to check if PhishTank is configured

### 2. PhishTank Service (`backend/phishtank_service.py`)
- Complete API client for PhishTank
- `check_url()` method to verify URLs against PhishTank database
- Comprehensive error handling (timeouts, network errors, API errors)
- Returns detailed information about phishing URLs
- Gracefully handles disabled state (no API key)

### 3. Main API Integration (`backend/main.py`)
- Added PhishTank checks to `/analyze/url` endpoint
- Updated `AnalysisResponse` model with `phishtank_check` field
- Updated `HealthResponse` model with `phishtank_enabled` field
- PhishTank results override ML predictions for verified phishing
- Backward compatible - works with or without API key

### 4. Configuration Files
- `backend/.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- Updated `.gitignore` - Exclude .env files from version control
- Added `requests` and `python-dotenv` to `requirements.txt`

### 5. Documentation
- **README.md**: Added PhishTank configuration section with setup instructions
- **docs/API.md**: Updated with PhishTank response fields and configuration guide
- **docs/SETUP.md**: Added detailed PhishTank setup steps and verification commands

### 6. Testing (`backend/tests/test_phishtank_service.py`)
Created 9 comprehensive unit tests:
- Service initialization (with/without API key)
- URL checking when disabled
- URL not in database (clean URLs)
- URL in database (verified phishing)
- URL in database (unverified)
- API errors (500 responses)
- Network timeouts
- Network errors

### 7. Demo Script (`backend/demo_phishtank.py`)
- Interactive demonstration of PhishTank integration
- Shows configuration status
- Tests sample URLs (if configured)
- Explains how the integration works

## How It Works

### Without PhishTank Configured
1. User analyzes a URL via the API
2. ML models provide phishing detection
3. Response includes `phishtank_check: null`
4. System works in ML-only mode

### With PhishTank Configured
1. User analyzes a URL via the API
2. PhishTank database is checked first
3. ML models provide independent analysis
4. If PhishTank confirms verified phishing:
   - Result is marked as phishing
   - Confidence is boosted to ≥0.95
   - PhishTank details included in response
5. Response includes complete `phishtank_check` data

## API Response Example

### Without PhishTank
```json
{
  "is_phishing": false,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "risk_level": "Safe",
  "features": {...},
  "model_used": "random_forest",
  "phishtank_check": null
}
```

### With PhishTank (URL not in database)
```json
{
  "is_phishing": false,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "risk_level": "Safe",
  "features": {...},
  "model_used": "random_forest",
  "phishtank_check": {
    "success": true,
    "in_database": false
  }
}
```

### With PhishTank (Verified phishing found)
```json
{
  "is_phishing": true,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "risk_level": "High Risk",
  "features": {...},
  "model_used": "random_forest",
  "phishtank_check": {
    "success": true,
    "in_database": true,
    "verified": true,
    "phish_id": 12345,
    "verified_at": "2024-01-01T12:00:00+00:00",
    "detail_url": "https://www.phishtank.com/phish_detail.php?phish_id=12345"
  }
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get PhishTank API Key
1. Visit https://www.phishtank.com/api_info.php
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Request an API key (free for non-commercial use)
4. Copy your API key

### 2. Configure PhishNet
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add: PHISHTANK_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### 3. Verify Configuration
```bash
python -c "from config import settings; print(f'PhishTank enabled: {settings.is_phishtank_configured()}')"
```

### 4. Test Integration
```bash
# Check health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Expected: "phishtank_enabled": true

# Analyze a URL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze/url \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://www.google.com"}'

# Response should include phishtank_check field
```

## Testing

### Run All Tests
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/ -v
```

**Expected Result**: All 35 tests pass
- 26 original tests (feature extraction, ML models, API)
- 9 new PhishTank service tests

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Configuration loading
- ✅ Service initialization
- ✅ URL checking (all scenarios)
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ API integration
- ✅ Response formatting

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Measures
1. **API Key Protection**
   - Stored in .env file (not in version control)
   - .env files excluded via .gitignore
   - Keys never logged or exposed in output
   - Demo script masks API keys completely

2. **Input Validation**
   - URLs validated before PhishTank check
   - Timeouts prevent hanging requests
   - Error handling for all API failures

3. **CodeQL Security Scan**
   - ✅ 0 vulnerabilities found
   - ✅ All security best practices followed

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced Detection**: Combines ML models with real-world phishing database
2. **Real-time Verification**: Checks against constantly updated PhishTank database
3. **Crowd-sourced Intelligence**: Leverages community-verified phishing reports
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality unchanged
5. **Optional Feature**: Works with or without API key
6. **Well Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage
7. **Secure**: API keys properly protected
8. **Documented**: Complete setup and usage guides

## Performance Impact

- **With PhishTank Enabled**: 
  - Additional 100-500ms for PhishTank API call
  - Can be optimized with caching if needed
  - Timeout set to 10 seconds (configurable)

- **Without PhishTank**: 
  - No performance impact
  - System works exactly as before

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Caching**: Cache PhishTank results to reduce API calls
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement request throttling
3. **Batch Checking**: Support multiple URL checks at once
4. **Statistics**: Track PhishTank hit rate
5. **Fallback**: Retry logic for transient failures
